# Replikate
*Minecraft Cloning Plugin*
#### 
The official documentation for the Replikate Minecraft Plugin

####

**Replikate** is a new take on server plugin capabilities... you can now clone Minecraft mobs and creatures using a specific recipe and the power of Mad Science!!!

With absolutely NO PERMISSIONS, and only 2 config values that ***CAN*** be changed, **Replikate** is a simple plugin that will make your online experience weird, wild fun!
####  
### Configuration

| Key | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| prefix | "&5[&uReplikate&5]&f >> " | The prepended string added to each message delivered from the plugin. **BE SURE** to use the `&` symbol to denote color codes! |
| genome-catalyst | 'PHANTOM_MEMBRANE' | This is ***a MATERIAL*** that is required for EACH clone procedure; defaults as Phantom Membrane, but can be changed to whatever is desired |

####

### Cloning Procedure

The cloning procedure is relatively simple, however there are some requirements to get the accurate clone egg you are looking for. Follow the recipes and format below and you will soon have any army of clones at your disposal!

#### Formaldehyde

**Formaldehyde** is a required ingredient to create clones of creatures in your server, and it is made by Brewing a **THICK** potion, then crafting it using the recipe below:  

| Air | Blaze Powder | Air |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Air | Thick Potion | Air |
| Air | Torch | Air |

#### Clone Layout

The clone layour is the same for every clone egg, however, the ***Entity Piece*** refers to the flesh, fur, piece of creature that is required to **Replikate** it into a clone egg.

####

| Air | Entity Piece | Air |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Air | Genome Catalyst | Air |
| Air | Formaldehyde | Air |

####

### Additional Drops

Along with the power of creation, **Replikate** has also added new **Mob / Creature Drops** to allow for **Replikating**. These drops can be accessed by either using ***Shears***, or by ***Killing*** the mob / creature in question.

Some creatures already have drops ( Squid, Chicken, Cow, Spider, Skeleton, etc ) and these items are used in the place of ***Entity Piece***.
